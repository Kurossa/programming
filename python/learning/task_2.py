Create proper python file with main function.

Create function that will ask you severeal question, of name, age, etc. Put users answer to variables. Put together answer as a one string an than print it in one command. 

Example.
#Ask for dogs name?
variable = dogs_name
#Ask for dog age?
variable2 = dogs_age

# this is only example try to do it, like in example, but also try to use formating it looks like 'Your name is: {0} and age of {1}'.Format(dogs_name,dogs_age) or any other way you like.
reply = 'Your dogs name is: ' + dogs_name + ' and its: ' + dogs age + 'years old'
print reply

Do it for few examples, questions does not matters. You can play with diffrent build-in python functions for strings. Pleas see documentation for strings in Python:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html
